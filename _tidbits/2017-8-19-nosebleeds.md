Saline (salt water) nasal spray is very useful for stopping nosebleeds. 
Instead of waiting for 5-10mins for the bleeding to stop, it usually takes around 1-2mins instead.

There are a large amount of blood vessels in the nose. 
One of the most common causes of nosebleeds is the drying of the nasal membranes. 
Saline spray alleviates this.
