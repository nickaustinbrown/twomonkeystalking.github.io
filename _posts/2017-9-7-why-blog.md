A blog seems a useful public instrument to have.   
Provided I know how to use it. Where the levers are.   
  
Of the few blogs I really enjoy, Different philosophies guide each of them.  
One writes complusivly, a habitual need to get the feel of his words perfectly matching his thoughts.    
One uses memectic surgery to reduce guilt based motivation. 
One writes superb essays through constantly re-writing. Continual polishing.  
One uses the blog as a tool to help her solve problems, it's a record of the path she took.   
Once she's solved the problem she ceases writing.  
  
Of all these I allign with the last one the most.   
  
I have a desire to do "measurable" things.   
I'm not opposed to visable projects, provided I keep them secret while I'm working on them.   
And don't get motivation from telling someone I'm working on something. Or the idea of the great reveal at the end.  
  
Why do I think I want visable projects?   
-guess at what s1 wants  
-legitimate excuses  
-being awesome  
  
what is the tension against this.   
-so my normal everyday stuff is not good enough/bad?  
-needing proof for other people is dangerous  
-perhaps this is the wrong tool  
  
Refactoring: I want "Things that look impressive to me and hence other people"  
I also want to chase after real goals. Not an illusory oasis of status or validation.   
eg: "When I do X, then people will love me" or "Once I've made it then I'll be happy"  
  
What is writing?  
-trying to share sematic objects.   
-clarifying my own thinking.   
--I get to see what I'm painting. -> see my thinking from the outside.   
This is similar to how you can tell good rockclimbing/dancing/art but not do it yourself.   
*this was a cool discovery*
