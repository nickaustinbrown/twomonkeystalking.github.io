So I feel like I just learned how to pass the mirror test.

"holy shit, I'm a thing, this person in the mirror is me, the words in my head are being thought through / in this"

It's kind of like that feeling when you look at your hand and you're all "whoa I can control these meat tentacles based on a whim" but stronger because damn, selves.

The world has been pretty surreal of late.
It can be wonderfully grounding though. If stuff is getting a little intense sometimes I can "deffuse" / break myself out of the context by going all "mannnn I'm here, right now, I exist"

My ability to see social things has increased also. Feel like I've got more agency / can really see the other person more. Noticing puns / double meanings all over the place :)

Had a bucketload of anxiety for the first time in my life last month. Tangled up with large life decisions.

Perhaps this is Val's [Looking thing](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/mELQFMi9egPn5EAjK/my-attempt-to-explain-looking-insight-meditation-and)?

Any resources / advice? Have people felt similar things?

Books in this space I haven't yet read:
The Mind Illuminated
Mastering the Core Teachings of the Buddha
The Seeing That Frees
